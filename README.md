# Project Title: Self-Balancing Ball



## Introduction
Welcome to the Self Balancing Ball project! This initiative aims to create a dynamically stable ball using robotics and control algorithms. The project focuses on achieving balance through precise control mechanisms, making the ball self-adjust and maintain stability during motion.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to design and implement a self-balancing ball that demonstrates stability control in real-world scenarios. By leveraging sensors, actuators, and advanced control algorithms, we aim to create a platform that showcases the potential of autonomous balance in a compact, spherical form.


## Components
### Servo Motor:
Servo motors or “servos”, as they are known, are electronic devices and rotary or linear actuators that rotate and push parts of a machine with precision. Servos are mainly used on angular or linear position and for specific velocity, and acceleration.

### Ultrasonic Sensor:
Ultrasonic sensors measure distance by using ultrasonic waves. The sensor head emits an ultrasonic wave and receives the wave reflected back from the target. Ultrasonic Sensors measure the distance to the target by measuring the time between the emission and reception.


### Arduino UNO:
Arduino UNO is a low-cost, flexible, and  easy-to-use programmable opensource microcontroller board that can be integrated into a variety of electronic projects. This board can be interfaced with other Arduino 
boards, Arduino shields, Raspberry Pi boards and can control relays, LEDs, servos, and motors as an output.

## PID Controller
A PID controller is an instrument used in industrial control applications to regulate temperature, flow, pressure, speed and other process variables. PID (proportional integral derivative) controllers use a control loop feedback mechanism to control process variables and are the most accurate and stable controller.
